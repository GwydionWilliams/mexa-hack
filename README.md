# MEXA Hackathons 
## Rules & Community Agreements 

### Code of Conduct 
We are all here to learn together and explore new ideas. We ask that you approach all hackathons with a kind and collaborative spirit. 

All hackathon participants will be held to the [Neuromatch Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  

Violations of the Code of Conduct should be reported by filling out our [Code of Conduct Violation Reporting form](https://airtable.com/shrezDSthWPlJ4Rpy). Complaints may be made anonymously and are visible only to members of the Neuromatch Conflict Resolution Office.

### Hackathon Rules 
1. Teams may have a maximum of 5 people.
2. Teams should be made up exclusively of accepted hackers who are not organizers, employees, mentors, judges, sponsors, or any other privileged position at the event.
3. Teams can gain advice and support from organizers, mentors, sponsors, and others.
4. All work on a project must be done during the hackathon's set timeframe.
5. Teams can use an idea they had before the event.
6. Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
7. Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.
8. Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the hackathon in determining the winners.
9. Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it's okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
10. Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), or other unsporting behaviour.

### Submission Requirements
For all virtual hackathons, you are required to submit your final project within 2 hours of the competition completion time. 

All projects should be submitted through [this link](). Submissions are required to include: 
* a link to the project code repository
* a slide deck sharing about your project. Please make a copy of [this slide deck]() and cover all of the included topics 
* if applicable, a recorded video demonstration of your project 

Judging will take place asynchronously for all virtual events. You won't have a chance to present your project to the judges synchronously, so please make sure your submission covers what you'd like to share with the judges!  

You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren’t able to finish. It's okay if you didn't finish your hack—that happens all the time!

### Judging Criteria 

* Integration of Lived Experience: 
* Security and Ethical Conciderations:
* Creativity: 
* Relevance and Execution: Is this project responsive to the challenge for which it was submitted? Is it a complete project or does it have a long way to go? Is it technically feasible? How usable or user-friendly is the proposed solution?
* Collaboration: We encourage and applaud interdisiplinary teams who are made up of members from different parts of the world.
