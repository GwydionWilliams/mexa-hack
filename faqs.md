# Frequently Asked Questions 

* Who can participate in a Hackathon?
  * Anyone over 18! Hackathons are not just for coders, but take a diverse team to think through the many aspects of building new software solutions for a given problem. MEXA hackathons center on the intersection of mental health and AI. Therefore people who are AI researchers, mental health researchers, mental health practicioners, software developers, industry leaders, and people with lived experience in mental health are especially helpful team members. 

* I am under 18. Can I participate?
  * Unfortunately, no. Our event is only open to people 18 years old and over.
    
* Do I need a team before I sign up for the hackathon?
  * No. You can register as a "free agent" and we'll help you find a team that's working on something interesting to you.
    
 * I don't see the hackathon sign up?
   * First you'll need to join at [mexa.app](mexa.app), and then navigate to "Events". You'll find the official sign up there.
